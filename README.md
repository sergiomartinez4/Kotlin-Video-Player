Kotlin Video Player
======================

This is a sample application that puts together a list of Videos that can be reproduced using the Brightcove Player SDK.
The application uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture and uses Android Architecture components like ViewModel and LiveData.
Each View item is a Material Card View and they are shown in a Recycler View.
You can easily add more videos to the list by modifying the player_plalist.json file in the assets folder. 
7The network requests are executed using Kotlin Coroutines.
